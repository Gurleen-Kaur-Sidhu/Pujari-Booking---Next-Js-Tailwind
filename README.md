## Routes and Authentication

This project includes multiple dashboards with protected routes:

- [Show userdashboard](https://pujari-booking-next-js-tailwind.vercel.app/userdashboard)
- [Show pujaridashboard](https://pujari-booking-next-js-tailwind.vercel.app/pujaridashboard)
- [Show superadmin](https://pujari-booking-next-js-tailwind.vercel.app/superadmin)

Originally, these routes were protected with authentication checks. However, since the backend is currently inactive, the authentication code has been temporarily commented out.

As a result, you can now access all routes directly via their links without restrictions.

Once the backend is active again, the protected routes will be re-enabled to secure these pages.
